# Car Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing a machine learning model for predicting car prices based on various features such as mileage, year of manufacture, engine size, etc. The model aims to provide accurate price predictions for used cars, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to understand the relationships between features.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Training multiple models, including linear regression, decision trees, and others.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter`

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lokesh2478/car-price-prediction-model.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Car Price Prediction Model.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells and train the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training is not included in this repository. You can use any dataset with car features and prices, such as [Kaggle Car Price Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
